This is a two-day development project designed to utilize various technologies related to web and iOS development. REST and APIs are used to fetch data from the internet with a NSURLSession. Data is parsed and displayed within a GUI (Graphical User Interface) which can be tailored to specifications and requirements. Thoughtful UI, custom transitions, and image caching is utilized for fluidity and usability.
The architecture of this project is built upon the MVC (Model View Controller) framework making it a collection of reusable functions. Deployment in this fashion creates interoperability within development teams, reducing confusion while working on larger projects allowing the team to get more done with less.
